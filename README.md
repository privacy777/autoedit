# autoedit

Edit your combo with python. (THIS IS AN OLD PROJECT, I'M TOTALLY REWRITING THE CODE, be sure to check for the latest branch updates from days to days)


## Features

- Automatic edits
- Output folders
- Procedural code
- Multiple modules


## Deployment

First install python 3+, then run this command before running the main script :

```bash
  pip install colorama
```


## FAQ

#### How does it work

It opens your combo.txt, loads the line and makes edit to them

#### Is the code complete ?

No, not at the moment, this is a 1 and a half year old project that i had on my pc, i will totally recode it because this is spaghetti code. Any help is welcome !



## Roadmap

- Code cleanup (important)

- Better performance and code optimisation

- Full rework using OOP. This procedural code is too long for nothing.

- Fix some modules / add new ones
